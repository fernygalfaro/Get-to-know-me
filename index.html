        <h2 class="introduction"> Introduction </h2>

        <p class="myself"> I am Fernando Alfaro, a Mexican-American and most of my family comes from Michoacan, Mexico.
            I have three older sisters and I am the youngest out of all my siblings. My love for technology
            comes from the love I have for video games. I have been playing video games since I was in diapers.
            Since I was young I have been repairing broken screens from Nintendo devices and that has translated to
            me building computers and fixing broken Macbook Pro's. I decided to take advantage of my interest in
            technology, so that's why I am pursuing a major in computer science. I hope to work for a great company
            where I get to develop some amazing programs.

        <h2> My Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <P class="hobby">
        My favorite hobby is to watercool computers. Watercooling is the method of cooling a computer with water 
        instead of air. Watercooling is achieved with radiators, fans, nickel-plated blocks, PETG or Acrylic tubes, fittings,
        and waterblocks. The main benefit of watercooling is to achieve better CPU and GPU clock speed while keeping system 
        temperatures low. My favorite aspect of watercooling is the customizability to make a computer look unique. Different brands
        sell gold and nickel fittings, different colored coolants, and RGB fans; moreover, all these tools make a computer look colorful
        and aesthetically pleasing. Many people refer to customized computers as battlestations.

        <h2> Fun Fact</h2>
        <p class="fact">
        A fun fact about myself is that I was a premature baby at eight months. So shortly after I was born I was rushed into an incubator 
        where I could further develop my lungs. I was lucky to survive and I am grateful to be here today.
